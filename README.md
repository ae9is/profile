# profile

A custom GitHub profile page.

## Why?

[See here for context.](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/4098)

Ideally GitHub would have finer grain permissions on profile privacy. Barring that, there's two options:
1. [Open your profile and obfuscate the contribution calendar](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/4098#discussioncomment-7731437)
2. Close your profile and roll your own page

This project explores the second option.

If you really don't care about the profile gamification and/or privacy, feel free to use this project anyways as a starter for your own personal page!  There's some intentional differences from the default profile, and a couple of Easter eggs just for fun.

If you want to clone some GitHub UI as closely as possible, you'll probably want to check out [GitHub's Primer](https://github.com/primer/react) design system.

## How to Use

Fork/clone and run the `refresh-data` GitHub Action once to start. Enable Pages.

From then, your user repository data should be updated weekly.
